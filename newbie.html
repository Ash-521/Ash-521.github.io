            <h2>What is EXPO?</h2>
            <p>EXPO (Extended Profiles for Overclocking) is a technology by AMD that optimizes the performance of RAM. It is an automatic setting that can make your RAM run faster and more efficiently without the need for manual overclocking.</p>
            <p>EXPO uses profiles that allow your motherboard to quickly and reliably find the best RAM clock and timings without requiring much intervention from you. This helps to unlock the full potential of your RAM, which is particularly noticeable in more demanding applications and games.</p>

        <section id="xmp">
            <h2>What is XMP?</h2>
            <p>XMP (Extreme Memory Profile) is a similar technology from Intel that also optimizes RAM performance. Unlike EXPO, which is specific to AMD, XMP is designed for Intel systems. XMP allows you to set the speed and latency of your RAM to a higher level by using pre-configured profiles created by the RAM manufacturer.</p>
            <p>This means you don't have to manually tweak your RAM settings to achieve the best performance. You can simply enable the XMP profile in the BIOS, and your RAM will run at its optimal settings.</p>

        <section id="activation">
            <h2>How to Activate EXPO and XMP?</h2>
            <p>To enable EXPO or XMP, you'll need to access your system's BIOS. Here are the steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Restart your PC and press the appropriate key (usually <strong>Del</strong> or <strong>F2</strong>) during boot to enter the BIOS.</li>
                <li>open EZ mode where you can see it immediatly or find it under Overclock.</li>
                <li>Enable the appropriate profile (EXPO for AMD (AM5) or XMP for Intel/AMD (AM4)).</li>
                <li>Save your settings and restart your PC. (save and exit) </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Once you've done this, your RAM will run at the rated settings, and you should notice a performance boost in applications and games.</p>
